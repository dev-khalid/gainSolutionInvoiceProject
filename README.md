# This project is a great failiur :( 

### There were the following tasks.

2. Implement authentication using oauth2.
3. Add 4 collections. Users, Customers, Invoice, Invoice items.
4. Add some demo seed for customers and invoices.

### Story Behind this project : 
I was given the tasks and had a deadline of 4 days . But i knew a little about the technologies that were mentioned in the task .I though that i would be able to complete those 
tasks . But i was not in that suation . I had my tuitions that's why i didn't have much time for learning and completing the tasks  and I gave up. 

>If I can't keep my promises or i know a little i should not take responsibility .
